# Intelligent SQL Injection Detection & Logging Dashboard

An intelligent web-based dashboard for detecting and logging SQL queries, combining traditional regex-based detection with an AI-driven model built using TensorFlow. This project provides real-time monitoring of SQL queries to identify potential SQL injection attacks and other malicious patterns, and logs these events in an SQLite database.

## Features

- **Real-Time SQL Query Logging:**  
  Capture and store SQL queries along with user metadata and IP addresses.

- **Dual-Layer Security Detection:**  
  Combine regex-based heuristics with a TensorFlow LSTM model to classify queries as benign or malicious.

- **Interactive Web Dashboard:**  
  Built with Flask and Bootstrap, the dashboard displays all query logs and highlights suspicious events.

- **Detailed Logging:**  
  Python’s built-in logging module captures debugging and security-related events for auditing and troubleshooting.

- **End-to-End System:**  
  From data preprocessing and model training to real-time inference and database integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** – Web framework for the dashboard.
- **SQLite** – Lightweight database for storing logs.
- **TensorFlow & Keras** – For building and training the AI model.
- **Pandas** – For data preprocessing.
- **Bootstrap** – For a responsive UI.
- **Logging** – Python’s logging module for monitoring application events.

## Project Structure

```

├── ai_detection_tf.py         # TensorFlow-based inference module
├── database.py                # Database operations
├── detection.py               # Regex-based SQL injection detection
├── logging_config.py          # Logging configuration

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-injection-detection.git
   cd sql-injection-detection
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install the following packages:*

   ```bash
   pip install Flask tensorflow pandas numpy
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Train the AI Model

Ensure your dataset (`Modified_SQL_Dataset.csv`) is in the project directory and formatted with columns such as `Query` and `Label`.

Run the training script:

```bash
python training_model_tf.py
```

This will tokenize your data, train a model, and save the trained model as `sql_model_tf.h5` and the tokenizer as `tokenizer.pickle`.

### 2. Run the Web Application

Once the model is trained, start the Flask web application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to access the dashboard.

### 3. Interact with the Dashboard

- **Log a New Query:**  
  Enter a SQL query (e.g., a benign command like `SELECT * FROM users;` or a malicious one like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1';`).  
  The system will classify the query and log it in the database.

- **View All Logs & Suspicious Events:**  
  Use the dashboard links to review logged queries and flagged suspicious events.

## Code Overview

- **training_model_tf.py:**  
  Reads a larger, labeled dataset, tokenizes the queries, trains a bidirectional LSTM model, and saves the model and tokenizer for inference.

- **ai_detection_tf.py:**  
  Loads the saved TensorFlow model and tokenizer, and defines a function to predict whether a new SQL query is suspicious.

- **database.py:**  
  Handles SQLite database connections and CRUD operations for logging queries and suspicious events.

- **detection.py:**  
  Provides regex-based detection functions for SQL injection patterns (as a supplementary method).

- **logging_config.py:**  
  Configures Python's logging to output debug and error messages to both the console and a log file.

- **main.py:**  
  Integrates all components into a Flask-based web dashboard with a Bootstrap-enhanced user interface.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand the Dataset:**  
  Integrate more real-world SQL query data for improved AI model performance.
- **User Authentication:**  
  Add authentication to secure access to the dashboard.
- **Advanced Analytics:**  
  Implement more detailed analytics and reporting for logged events.
- **Real-Time Alerts:**  
  Integrate email or SMS notifications for immediate alerts on suspicious activity.
